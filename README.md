# Capstone Project: Packet Sniffing and Network Traffic Analysis

## Overview

This project involved packet sniffing and analysis of network traffic using tools like Wireshark, tcpdump, and Scapy. The objectives were to:

- Compare different packet capture tools and their use cases
- Analyze common protocols like DNS, TCP, HTTP, UDP, ICMP, and SSL/TLS in Wireshark
- Capture and analyze traffic in tcpdump
- Implement a DNS poisoning attack 
- Implement a TCP session hijacking attack
- Analyze intercepted YouTube traffic using Wireshark, Nmap, and Scapy

## Tools Used

- Wireshark
- Tcpdump 
- Scapy
- Nmap

## Key Topics Covered

- Packet sniffing 
- Analysis of protocols like DNS, TCP, HTTP, UDP, ICMP, SSL/TLS
